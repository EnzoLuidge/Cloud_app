This project demonstratesxxhow to deploy a scalable web asdfpplication using AWS services, including EC2, Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and DynamoDB. The application is a simdfpledf Flask web app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts, with data stored in DynamoDB.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:

VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud to host the resources.

Subnets: Two public subnets in different availability zones.

Internet Gateway: To allow internet access.

Security Groups: To control inbound and outbound traffic.

EC2 Instances: Hosting the Flask application.

Auto Scaling Group: To automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

Application Load Balancer (ALB): To distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

DynamoDB: To store application data.

IAM Roles: To provide the necessary permissions to EC2 instances.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources.

AWS CLI installed and configured.

An SSH key pair in your AWS account (you'll need the key pair name).

## Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/EnzoLuidge/Cloud_app.git

cd Cloud_app

Update the CloudFormation Template:

Ensure the template.yaml file located in the YAML directory has the correct AMI ID for your region and the name of your SSH key pair:


Resources:

  MyEC2Instance:
  
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    
    Properties:
    
      ImageId: ami-04716897be83e3f04 # Update this to a valid AMI ID in your region
      
      KeyName: YourKeyPairName # Update this to your key pair name

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Deploying the CloudFormation Stack

Navigate to the YAML directory:

cd YAML

Create the CloudFormation stack:

aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name MyCloudAppStack --template-body file://template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

Wait for the stack to be created:

You can monitor the stack creation process in the AWS CloudFormation console.

## Using the Application

Once the stack is created, follow these steps to use the application:

**Retrieve the Load Balancer DNS Name:**

Go to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

Click on "Load Balancers" in the left menu.

Find the ALB created by the CloudFormation stack and copy its DNS name.

**Access the Application:**

Open your web browser and navigate to the ALB DNS name.

You should see the application homepage where you can add, view, edit, and delete posts.

## Load Testing with Locust

To perform load testing on the application, follow these steps:

Install Locust:

pip install locust

Navigate to the LOCUST directory:

cd LOCUST

Run Locust:

locust -f locust.py

Open Locust Web Interface:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8089.

Configure the number of users and the spawn rate.

Start the test to simulate load on your application.

## Cleanup

To delete all resources created by the CloudFormation stack, run:

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name MyCloudAppStack
